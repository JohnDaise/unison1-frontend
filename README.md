Unison is an app for working musicians. Those who are regularly working in a gig economy with a variety of players often don't need to find opportunities but rather need a single page to connect/disseminate information with other working musicians. This is where Unison is helpful. Band leaders/MDs can add on other musicians to a particular gig and on that page share important notes and links so everyone can be on the same page.
