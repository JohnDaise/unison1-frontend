Statement:

Often band leaders/ music directors and singer/songwriters pull from a variety of technologies to prepare hired musicians for gigs whether that's text, email, google calendar, Facebook, Dropbox or other file sharing services. Unison is meant to be a single landing page for handling all of those logistics when preparing for a performance.

Unison is an app for working musicians. Those who are regularly working in a gig economy with a variety of players often don't need to find opportunities but rather need a single page to connect/disseminate information with other working players. This is where Unison is helpful. Band Leaders/Music Directors/Solo Artists can add other musicians onto a particular gig and on that page share important notes, details, and links so everyone can be on the same page.


 TL ; DR:  Unison is an organizational tool for working musicians and it is meant to be an open network.



Features:

Users

Users can either operate as Organizers(creators/leaders of an event) or as Players(users hired to participate in an event).



Create Events

Organizers can create events on the "MyEvents" page. Here they can see a list of all the events they have created and a calendar for reference with all of those event dates highlighted. Each Event list item is a clickable link which leads to the "Event Detail Page".



Event Detail Page

Here is the main page where an organizer can edit details of a particular event and share posts with the "Players".  Players who have been added to an event show up on the right side of the page. On the left side of the page is where the event details live.

In the center of the page is where the Organizer's posts render. The organizer can share YouTube links, links to pdfs or jpg files. An organizer can also simply leave a message to the Players.. Posts will render in the order of most recent posts at the top of the page.


Players Page

This is where an Organizer can search, find and add Players to any events that they have created. Each Player has a simple card with contact info and short bio. At the top of this page is a dropdown where they can select any of their created events. Below the dropdown is a search bar, which on typing filters the list below. This search is an inclusive "Or" search. At the bottom of the page is an "Add Player" button which will add a player to the event that is selected in the dropdown.



Gigs Page

On the "Gigs Page" you can see all of the events that you as a user were hired to participate in as a "Player". This page is similar to the "MyEvents" page with the exception of the editing features.
