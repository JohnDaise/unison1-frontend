        Unison is an app for working musicians. Those who are regularly working in a gig economy with a variety of players often don't need to find opportunities but rather need a single page to connect/disseminate information with other working players. This is where Unison is helpful. Band Leaders/Music Directors/Solo Artists can add other musicians onto a particular gig and on that page share important notes, details, and links so everyone can be on the same page.
